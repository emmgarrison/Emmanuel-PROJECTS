## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge, I'm learning about CI/CD pipeline that takes code from commit to production, gaining practical DevOps skills.

By the end of the 7 days, I will have...
-Built a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools
-Automated the testing and deployment of a real application
-Created 7 pieces of portfolio-worthy documentation that showcase my skills

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 8 hours every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable by learning, practising hands-on projects, troubleshooting, researching and documentation writing. My reward for completing this DevOps challenge will be taking breaks and then continue undertaking more projects.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software.
DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. They...
-Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.
-Containerize applications using tools like S3, Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.
-Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for CI (continuous integration) and CD (continuous delivery). This process helps teams by making the flow from code changes to a live application (Production) as efficient and reliable as possible. To do this, automations are set up across the software development and deployment process.
