Hi there,
I am an IT professional with more than 10 years of success delivering projects in Waterfall and Agile environments.  My expertise lies at the intersection of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and software development, where I specialize in deploying ERP applications, optimizing hybrid cloud environments and driving operational excellence.
My goal is to transition into senior roles in cloud security, hence I'm undertaking courses, training and upskilling in cloud security projects.
